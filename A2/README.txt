Description: a program that enables client sending packets to server for requesting access to celluar
network. The server will verify the client's identification by checking the txt database information.
If the server can't find client's subscriber num in the database, or if subscriber num found but tech
type mismatch, the server will respond by sending Not Exit message; if subscriber not paid, the server
will respond by sending Not Paid message; otherwise, the server will send a permit to access message.

Assumption: 
1. the client only resend packet when time out happens(receiving no response within 3 seconds),
the client can resend up to 3 times for time out situation, if still no response from server, an error
message will be generated by the client. 
2. Assume server response packet tech type is the same as client sending packet, if the subscriber 
number not found, the response packet tech type will be set as 0x00

How to compile and run the program? (instructions for macOS)
1. Open your terminal, go to the directory where the program file existis
2. Compile server.c by running "/usr/bin/clang -o server server.c"
3. Compile client.c by running "/usr/bin/clang -o client client.c"
4. Running compiled server file by inputing command line "./server 50000", here 50000 is the port number, 
you can also choose any other valid port number
5. Open another terminal to run compiled client file by inputing command line "./client localhost 50000"
6. To test time out sending error, the user could run compiled client file at first

Here are the test data for testing different verification situations:
packets[0]: 4085546805 - Not Found -> subscriber number not found in database
packets[1]: 4086668821 - Not Paid
packets[2]: 4086808821 - Permit access
packets[3]: 4087320501 - Not Found because technology mismatch
packets[4]: 4085876566 - Permit access
